The course Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python introduced SQL statements and functions. I worked on both the platforms; IBM Db2 database service via IBM cloud and an SQL practice tool called Datasette. 
Week 1-3 introduced practicing SQL statements like SELECT, CREATE, DROP, TRUNCATE, etc. and working with multiple tables. 
Week 4 provided working with SQL magic database to work with SQL statements in the python envrionment. 
Week 5 consisted of the final assignment.
